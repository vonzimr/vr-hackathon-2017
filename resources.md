#Resources for the VR Hackathon

# A-Frame Resources

## Installation

Install from npm:
```
# npm install aframe angle live-server
```
Where:
* aframe is the library we'll be using for vr
* angle is a set of commandline tools for aframe (see below)
* live-server is needed to run the aframe project

TODO: create a package.json for npm so we can just install everything from
scratch for our project. More info: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/install

## Using angle
Angle resources: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angle 
To start with a blank project, run `angle initscene`, then inside the newly
created angle project run ``npm run start`` to launch a server

TODO: figure out what it means when it asks for tracked controls with hand
models.
